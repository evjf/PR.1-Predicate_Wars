# Predicate Wars

<img align="right" height="150" src="logo.svg">

Predicate Wars is an upcoming card game based heavily on predicate logic, including formal statements, and logical inferences, with highly flexible gameplay<!-- i hope so -->. A Calvinball-like game but for actual nerds who actually want to win the game. Check the [rulebook](game.md) for the rules.
